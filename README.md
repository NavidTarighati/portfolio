## ðŸ“Š Sales Dashboard â€“ AdventureWorksDW2022

**Tools**: SQL Server, Power BI, DAX  
**Description**: Built an interactive dashboard analyzing product and sales performance. 
This two part project starts with querying the dataset for Performance Analysis, Customer Analysis, Inventory Analysis, Profitability Analysis, Employee Analysis and Marketing Analysis.
Following this step, a view is created to use for visualization. 
The visualization takes place in Power BI with 3 interactive dashboards for Sales Overview, Customer Details and Product Details.

## ðŸ“Š Call Center Dashboard

**Tools**:  Power BI, DAX  
**Description**: Built an interactive dashboard analyzing call center performance. 
Offering a dashboard for the Customer Support Operations to help understand the performance by filtering through the agents, support ticket topics, date of ticket submission.

## ðŸ“Š Revenue & Customer Insights â€“ Movie Rental Business

**Tools**: SQL Server  
**Description**: An analysis and report for actions and insights to help the business. 
Conducted a comprehensive data analysis project on a movie rental business using SQL Server, with the goal of uncovering actionable business insights.
This project focuses on querying the database to perform detailed analyses across key operational areas including Film & Category Performance, Customer Value, Inventory Usage, Store & Staff Productivity, and Geographic & Temporal Trends.

The insights were synthesized into a structured report highlighting patterns in customer behavior, category profitability, seasonal revenue trends, and RFM-based segmentation. Key metrics such as top-performing films, loyal customers, peak months, and underperforming inventory were identified to support strategic decision-making.

## ðŸ“Š Customer Segmentation with K-Means â€“ Online Retail II Dataset

**Tools**: Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook 
**Description**: Performed end-to-end customer segmentation using the Online Retail II dataset to identify behavioral clusters based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values.
This project involved thorough data cleaning, outlier analysis, and feature scaling before applying K-Means clustering.
Both Elbow Method and Silhouette Score were used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Clusters were visualized using 3D scatter plots and violin plots to understand purchasing patterns.
Insights were synthesized in two reportsâ€”one focusing on Cluster Profiles and another on Outlier Analysisâ€”each with action-based recommendations tailored to customer value and engagement.
